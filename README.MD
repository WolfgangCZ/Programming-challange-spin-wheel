#PROGRAMMING CHALLENGE SPIN WHEEL

First of all - DONT LOOK AT THE CODE, its awful.

This is a programming challenge spin wheel, you can choose programming language, challenge or framework or make custom list of options and then spin it and see what you have to do.

Custom options dont work yet

Thats all pretty much. 

TODO: implement filters for options
TODO: implement popup window 
TODO: implement promt for custom option
